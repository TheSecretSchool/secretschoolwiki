[...] note the 59 drawings by Henri-A. Zo that accompany the text: one page of illustration opposite each page of verse. Roussel hired a private detective firm to deliver his instructions to the illustrator. Zo did not know who had hired him nor did he know what he was illustrating, other than the short descriptions Roussel wrote for each of the fifty-nine drawings (his constraint). The drawings themselves are unremarkable and illustrate small portions of the page which precedes them.
