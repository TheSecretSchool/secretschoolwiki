type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

At a meeting with Dimitis Charitos yesterday, he very generously and in good spirits agreed to host the "Secret School" installation at the [[Hybrid City 3 conference|http://uranus.media.uoa.gr/hc3/]], which he is organizing. We also chose together to organize a performance/jam/party in the atrium of the [[Department of Communication and Mass Media|http://www2.media.uoa.gr/main/eng/index_eng.html]] building of AU on Saturday, September 19, to close the conference.  If all goes well, we shall be jamming together.
