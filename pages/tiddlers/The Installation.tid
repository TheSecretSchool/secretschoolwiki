type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Secret School Installation is a collaborative art piece based on a local WiFi network where visitors of the installation can share information about immigration confidentially and anonymously. It is at the same time a platform for collaborative storytelling, where visitor's congtributions are merged in multiple narrative contexts: Raymond Roussel's poem "Nouvelles Impressions d'Afrique", audio recordings, interview transcripts and photos from a trip tracing an immigrants journey from Georgia to Greece, and fleetig fragments of impressions related to vagrant life captured in Greece. The installation is accessible on any web-enabled mobile device, while excerpts of the material are projected on a touch-screen or wall surface.
