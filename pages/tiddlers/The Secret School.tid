title: The Secret School
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

At the core of the Secret School concept is the [[Pirate Box|http://piratebox.cc]], a local ~WiFi network where visitors of the installation can share information about immigration confidentially and anonymously.  Visitors can exchange messages through a chat room and upload texts, various types of documents or media files.  The network is local, fully separated from the Internet, and can be transported between different locations in a small suitcase, or even on a bicycle or suspended from a balloon.  As such it can collect and share information contributed by the visitors while providing complete safety from snooping.  The [[PirateBox|http://piratebox.cc/]] is "a DIY anonymous offline file-sharing and communications system".  In the 1990ies one of the first Cyber-communities served as a kind of Underground Railroad helping refugees from the Balkan wars to escape into the West.  Twenty years later, the Internet is being increasingly policed.  Protecting personal information has become a central issue in the Mainstream.  For majority of Immigrants, confidentiality is not merely a matter of protection of the personal sphere, but of downright vital importance.  By using DIY tools that are out of the reach of Internet information tracking, this work seeks to promotes awareness and discussion on the clandestine aspects of Immigration, but also to put such tools in the hands of all those for whom independence from surveillance is of importance.
