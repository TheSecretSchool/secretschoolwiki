Documentation about a recent action of the Ultra-red (URXX):

<<<
//For twenty years Ultra-red have developed sound investigations alongside and within social movements. Members conduct inquiries in teams based in Berlin, London, the rural southwest of England, New York, and Los Angeles. In October 2014, Ultra-red gathered in Cologne, Germany to mark two decades of experiments in organized listening. Hosted by the Akademie der KÃ¼nste der Welt as part of their Pluriversale initiative, with support from the Department of Cultural Affairs of the City of Los Angeles, URXX featured a series of public events and workshops during which Ultra-red members reflected on what they have learned as cultural producers, organizers, and researchers with years of commitment to specific political struggles. This documentary features interviews and captures encounters with local artists and activists in Cologne.//

//ULTRA-RED: URXX 1994-2014: SECOND ENCOUNTER
 
A sound art and performance project by Ultra-red.

"URXX" is a project to mark the twentieth anniversary of the international sound art collective, Ultra-red, founded in 1994. By using electroacoustic music compositions and performance, the aim is to re-encounter the political struggles against exclusion and oppression. Thus "URXX" presents an analysis of past and on-going struggles of migration through the lens of housing, gender, radical education or anti-racism.//
